# Image-Processing-Project
In this project, we try to detect the pedestrians and the cars on a sequence of images forming a video, and calculate the efficiency with MOTA method.
This project has been done for the Ottawa University's CSI4533 (Image Processing) course in the winter 2022. 
The professor for this course was Robert Lagani√®re.
